      <h4>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System? </h4>
      <p> Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git is essentially a collection of commands and processes to collect and share a snapshot of a project. Version control systems like Git allow individuals and teams alike to keep track of the changes they make on a project, and they make it possible for teams to share and exchange code efficiently. Version control also provides backup and access to previous version of a project, making sure that a simple mistake cannot ruin a project.

      <h4>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project â€“ multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h4>
      <p> 

      A "local repo" is a repository that lives on the computers of team members, while a "remote repo" is a repository hosted on a server accessible to all team members--often the internet or a local network. Remote repositories are what make it possible for teammates to share and exchange code. The actual changes to the code or project happen in local repositories. Any modification to a project is made and committed locally. So, to collaborate with GIT, each team member would clone the remote repository. Then they could make changes on their local repository, then those changes would be staged, committed, and pushed from their local repository to the remote repository. Teammates could then pull the new version from the remote repository to their local repository.
