      <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
      <p>Docker is an open source tool for making containers. Developers use containers like Docker to contain an application with all of its libraries, dependencies, etc. By packing everything together, containers make creating, deploying, and running an application more seemless. Because everything is packaged together, the application will run on any Linux machine, even if it has customized settings.

      <h2>What is Nginx?</h2>
      <p> Nginx is an open source web server. A web serverâ€˜s fundamental job is to use Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to fulfill users requests by serving the files that form Web pages. If a computer hosts a Web site, it must have a Web server program like Nginx. Nginx was built specifically to offer low memory usage and high concurrency. Although Apache is the most widely-used Web server, Nginx tends to outperform Apache becasue it is rooted in scalable performance optimization.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)?</h2>
      <p> A virtual machine, also called an image, essentially creates a computer within a computer, running an operating system and application separtely from the hosting computer. A virtual machine is also closed off from the rest of the system, so the software on a virtual machine can't affect the actual computer. Virtual machines have many uses but are often used for testing updates or new applications or for using applications that run best on a different operating system.
